## To do: 
 - Git installation guide for Mac OS X
 - Git installation guide for Linux
 - Method of making sure that the guide versions (currently 1.0 for Git 2.43.0)
## Questions:
 - Should we add the date of creation to the guides or is the corresponding Git version enough?
 - Is there an automated way to mark these guides as outdated once Git is published as a version greater than 2.43.0?
 - Do we need installation guides for iPhones, iPads and similar Android devices?
 - Are the official GitHub guides good enough or do we need other or our own versions?
