# Security Policy for Phoenix SC2

**1. Reporting Security Vulnerabilities:**
If you discover a vulnerability within Phoenix SC2, please report it via email to tc.haecker@gmail.com. We appreciate your effort in improving the security of our project.

**2. Response to Security Reports:**
Upon receiving a security report, we will consult with experts, including seeking advice from ChatGPT, to understand the issue's severity and impact. We will then take the necessary steps to address the vulnerability promptly.

**3. Disclosure Policy:**
We will evaluate the need for public disclosure of a security issue on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the advice received and the potential impact on our users. Currently, we do not have a dedicated channel for such disclosures, but we are working on establishing communication methods for future updates.

**4. Acknowledgments:**
We respect the privacy of individuals reporting vulnerabilities. If they wish to be acknowledged, we will gladly give credit in our project updates or communications, acknowledging their valuable contribution to the project's security.

**5. Security Updates and Patches:**
As the project is in its early stages, we are still developing our process for handling and deploying security updates or patches. We aim to establish a structured approach as the project evolves.

## Supported Versions

As no code has been written, yet, it is unlikely that Phoenix SC2 has security issues. This is why we marked all versions lower than 1.0 as secure. This might change.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| < 1.0   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For now please report vulnerabilities per E-Mail to tc.haecker@gmail.com

Once more people work on Phoenix SC2 we intend to improve the reporting.
