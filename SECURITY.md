# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As no code has been written, yet, it is unlikely that Phoenix SC2 has security issues. This is why we marked all versions lower than 1.0 as secure. This might change.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| < 1.0   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For now please report vulnerabilities per E-Mail to tc.haecker@gmail.com

Once more people work on Phoenix SC2 we intend to improve the reporting.
